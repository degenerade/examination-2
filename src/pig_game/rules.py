RULES_TEXT = """Pig is a push-your-luck dice game played to 100 points.

On your turn you may:
  • Enter 'r' to roll and add to your turn score.
  • Enter 'h' to hold and bank your current turn score.
  • Enter 'q' to quit the round early.
  • Enter '+' to add 10 points (testing cheat).

Rolling a 1 ends the turn and you lose any unbanked turn score.
The first player to reach 100 total points wins the round."""
